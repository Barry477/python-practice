# Function to sum all elements in a list 
# I need to calculate the tota of all numbers in a list 
# My plan:
# Start with total = 0
# Go through each number using a for loop
# Keep adding each number to the total
# Finally, return the total sum

def sum_list(numbers):
  total = 0
  for sum in numbers:
    total += num # Add each number to total
return total

# Exanple usage
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
